DRUG_EXPOSURE,cdm,quantity,No,,,float,0,,,"To find the dose form of a drug the RELATIONSHIP table can be used where the relationship_id is 'Has dose form'. If liquid, quantity stands for the total amount dispensed or ordered of ingredient in the units given by the drug_strength table. If the unit from the source data does not align with the unit in the DRUG_STRENGTH table the quantity should be converted to the correct unit given in DRUG_STRENGTH. For clinical drugs with fixed dose forms (tablets etc.) the quantity is the number of units/tablets/capsules prescribed or dispensed (can be partial, but then only 1/2 or 1/3, not 0.01). Clinical drugs with divisible dose forms (injections) the quantity is the amount of ingredient the patient got. For example, if the injection is 2mg/mL but the patient got 80mL then quantity is reported as 160.
