If end dates are not provided in the source there are three ways in which to derive them:
- Outpatient Visit: visit_end_datetime = visit_start_datetime
- Emergency Room Visit: visit_end_datetime = visit_start_datetime
- Inpatient Visit: Usually there is information about discharge. If not, you should be able to derive the end date from the sudden decline of activity or from the absence of inpatient procedures/drugs.
- Non-hospital institution Visits: Particularly for claims data, if end dates are not provided assume the visit is for the duration of month that it occurs.
