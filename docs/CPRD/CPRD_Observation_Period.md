# CDM Table name: OBSERVATION_PERIOD

Remove any patients whose OBSERVATION_PERIOD_START_DATE is prior to their OBSERVATION_PERIOD_END_DATE. An example of a scenario where a patient could have no valid observation time occurs when the patientâ€™s transfer out date (patient.tod) is prior to the date the practice is deemed to be of research quality (practice.uts). CPRD verified that about 10% of patients do not contribute any valid observation time to the database.

| observation_period_id |  |  | Autogenerate |
| person_id | patid |  |  |
| observation_period_start_date | frd | Take the latest date between patient.frd and practice.uts.  | max(patient.frd, practice.uts) |
| observation_period_end_date | tod | Take the earliest date between patient.tod, practice.lcd, and the date data received. | Use min(patient.tod, practice.lcd,date data received). <br><br> THEMIS rule #23 now allows for data to be retained after the OBSERVATION_PERIOD_END_DATE and an option is now available in ATLAS to include that data in an analysis. |
