# CDM Table name: VISIT_OCCURRENCE

## Reading from JMDC.Claim

Each unique claim id for a patient will be assigned to a visit, **except for pharmacy claims**. In claims only the year + month is provided, day information is not available. However, oftentimes a claim will be associated with a piece of information that does have a specific date.  Specific dates can come from prescription date, procedure date, admission date, discharge date, or the start of medical care date.  This information will be used to infer the visit date with more precision. (e.g. if it’s a 2 day visit, and it has a procedure taking place on the 20th, we might assume the visit starts on the 20th).  If no specific date is available, we will assume the visit start and any events associated with the visit fall on the 15th of the month.  We choose the middle of the month because accidental reversal of temporality (where the order of events is switched because one piece of information did have a date, and another didn’t) is just as likely to occur in one direction as the other.
