The IBM速 MarketScan速 Research Databases
capture person-specific clinical utilization,
expenditures, and enrollment across inpatient,
outpatient, prescription drug, and carve-out
services. The data come from a selection of large
employers, health plans, and government and public
organizations. The MarketScan Research Databases
link paid claims and encounter data to detailed
patient information across sites and types of
providers and over time. The annual medical
databases include private-sector health data from
approximately 350 payers. Historically, more than
20 billion service records are available in the
MarketScan databases. These data represent the
medical experience of insured employees and their
dependents for active employees, early retirees,
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
(COBRA) continuees, and Medicare-eligible
retirees with employer-provided Medicare
Supplemental plans.

### Commercial Claims and Encounters Database
The IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and
Encounters (CCAE) Database contains data from
active employees, early retirees, COBRA
continuees, and dependents insured by employersponsored plans (i.e., individuals not eligible for
Medicare).

### Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits Database
The IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental and
Coordination of Benefits (COB) Database (also
known as MDCR) is created for Medicare-eligible
retirees with employer-sponsored Medicare
Supplemental plans. This database contains
predominantly fee-for-service plan data. Both the Medicare-paid amounts and the employerpaid supplemental insurance amounts are included
in this database. Only plans in which both the
Medicare-paid amounts and the employer-paid
amounts were available and evident on the claims
were selected for this database.
