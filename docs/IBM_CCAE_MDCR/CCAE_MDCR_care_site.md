## Table name: **CARE_SITE**

The **CARE_SITE** table contains a list of uniquely identified points of care, or an individual clinical location within an organization. Each CARE_SITE belongs to one ORGANIZATION.

MarketScan does not have clear care site information so this table will only contain one value representing the fact that no care site information will be captured.
