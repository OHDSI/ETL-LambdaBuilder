# CDM Table name: VISIT_DETAIL

VISIT_DETAIL records will be created from both the Encounter and the CareArea tables. Each VISIT_DETAIL record will be associated with a VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID. Please refer to the visit logic for how that was done.

## Reading from OPTUM_EHR.Encounter

Starting with the Encounter table, de-duplicate records by ptid, encid, interaction_type, interaction_date, and interaction_time. After de-duplication each record should create a record in VISIT_DETAIL. 

To find a provider associated with a VISIT_DETAIL record, join to the encounter_provider table on encounter.encid = encounter_provider.encid. If more than one provider is associated to a record, the provider with provider_role of 'ATTENDING' should be prioritized. If there is more than one provider with the provider_role of 'ATTENDING', pick one. If no provider has the role of 'ATTENDING' then sort by provider_role and choose the first.

## Reading from OPTUM_EHR.CareArea

First remove any records where CareArea.carearea is 'OTHER CARE AREA' or 'UNKNOWN CARE AREA'. Then, de-duplicate records by ptid, encid, carearea, carearea_date, and carearea_time. After de-duplication each record should create a record in VISIT_DETAIL. 

To find a provider associated with a VISIT_DETAIL record, join to the encounter_provider table on carearea.encid = encounter_provider.encid. If more than one provider is associated to a record, the provider with provider_role of 'ATTENDING' should be prioritized. If there is more than one provider with the provider_role of 'ATTENDING', pick one. If no provider has the role of 'ATTENDING' then sort by provider_role and choose the first.

## Change Log
- All de-duped encounters now create VISIT_DETAIL records
- Records from CareArea now create VISIT_DETAIL records
