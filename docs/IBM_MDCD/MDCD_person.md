description: "**PERSON** mapping from IBM MarketScanÂ® Medicaid (MDCD) **ENROLLMENT_DETAIL**."

## Table name: **PERSON**

### Key conventions
* The **ENROLLMENT_DETAIL** table stores multiple records for each person, one for each month they are enrolled in a health plan.  However, the CDM will only store one record per person in the **PERSON** table.  
  * Only records where the person has prescription benefits (DRUGCOVG =1) or eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare coverage (MEDICARE =1) are used.
* Start by evaluating all **ENROLLMENT_DETAIL** records and **remove** the following persons:
  * Individuals with two different, valid sex values (1 or 2) over different ENROLLMENT_DETAIL records
  * Individuals with Year(GETDATE()) - max(DOBYR) < 90 AND max(DOBYR) >= min(DOBYR) +2 
* After defining persons to remove, then use the most recent record in **ENROLLMENT_DETAIL** to define demographic information in the CDM for the remaining persons
* After finding the latest record per person, delete the following:
  * Individuals whose DOBYR &lt; 1900 or &gt; the current year.
  * Individuals born &gt; 1 year after their first enrollment period.

* For MONTH_OF_BIRTH, the **OBSERVATION_PERIOD** table will need to be generated first. Then, the value can be derived from using YEAR_OF_BIRTH and OBSERVATION_PERIOD_START_DATE only if the year of birth is equal to the year of the first OBSERVATION_PERIOD_START_DATE.

## Change Log
**19-Feb-2021**: Correct the exclusion based on year of birth to read "Delete the following members:  Year(GETDATE()) - max(DOBYR)  < 90 AND max(DOBYR) >= min(DOBYR) +2". Once a person reaches 90 years of age their birth year is incremented up to protect patient privacy.
