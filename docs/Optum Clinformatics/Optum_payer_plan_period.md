# CDM Table: PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD

This table will be sourced from the **Member_Enrollment** table except for those persons not in person table. The lineage to source is maintained through Pat_PlanId. Thus, every row record in PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD will have a 1:1 lineage row from the **Member_Enrollment** source table; but not all rows in source table may have a row in PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD. 

Just like in the source **Member_Enrollment** table, a person will have a new row record in PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD every time there is change in any information about the member, such as state or product. If there are overlaps in enrollment periods in source table, those overlaps will also exist in PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD.  

## **PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD Table Logic**

- Delete all records for a person who is not in OMOP *PERSON* table.  
- If the earliest ELIGEFF occurs prior to 05/01/2000 revise ELIGEFF to match the start date of data `MAX(ELIGEFF, '05-01-2000')`
- If the latest ELIGEND > **Member_Continuous_Enrollment** last date of Extract_Ym, then edit `ELIGEND = MAX(ELIGEND, Extract_Ym)`
- Delete all records in **Member_Enrollment** with `ELIGEND < '05/01/2000'`
