# CDM Table: VISIT_DETAIL

This table will be populated from three source tables, **MEDICAL_CLAIMS**, **RX_CLAIMS**, **INPATIENT_CONFINEMENT** tables. 

## **Record level referential integrity with source**
Record level referential integrity is important for drug utilization and health economics analysis. Records from the source will be preserved to the best of our ability in the CDM. The records in the **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** tables is allowed to be duplicated (because there maybe multiple charges on a single claim line or there mabye multiple standard costs listed). 

While creating records in the **VISIT_DETAIL** table the duplicate claim lines will **not** be consolidated. Any duplicate procedures or diagnoses resulting from the duplicated claim lines will not affect analysis. See the **PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE** table for how to use procedure units. The charges and costs will be preserved in the **COST** table, creating a 1:many relationship between the **COST** table and the **VISIT_DETAIL** table. See [logic](#VISIT_DETAIL-Logic) below for details.

The **VISIT_DETAIL** table will have 1:1 record level referential integrity to **MEDICAL_CLAIMS**, **INPATIENT_CONFINEMENT** and **RX_CLAIMS** - except as noted below. 

## **Special notes**
- **VISIT_DETAIL**.VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID, a system generated primary key of the **VISIT_DETAIL** will be the fk to many OMOP tables including domain-tables (**CONDITION_OCCURRENCE**, **PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE**, **OBSERVATION**, **MEASUREMENT**, **DRUG_EXPOSURE**, etc.) and to **COST** table **COST**.COST_EVENT_ID).
- **VISIT_OCCURRENCE** will be generated from **VISIT_DETAIL** table through an 'era' logic where inpatient records will be grouped together into continous non-overlapping periods, and all visit_detail records (inpatient, outpatient, other) that are in that temporal non overlapping continous period will be considered one visit_occurrence_id record. For records outside this non-overlapping inpatient period, we will take all outpatient records and identify unique person-date combinations. For each unique person-date combination a visit_occurrence_id will be assigned and all visit_detail_id records temporally assocciated with that person-date combination will be assigned that visit_occurrence_id. (See documentation for **VISIT_OCCURRENCE**.visit_occurrence_id)
- Linkages across source tables should use the combination of PATID and PAT_PLANID.

## **VISIT_DETAIL Logic**
1. Remove persons not in person table
2. Create a primary key to identify each record in the **MEDICAL_CLAIMS**, **INPATIENT_CONFINEMENT** and **RX_CLAIMS** tables. This primary key will become the **VISIT_DETAIL_ID**. Retain this information as a lookup table for later linkage of diagnoses and procedures. This system generated key may also be used to lookup records in source table i.e. maintain a lookup table that is able to link visit_detail_id to the records of **MEDICAL_CLAIMS**, **INPATIENT_CONFINEMENT** and **RX_CLAIMS** tables (record level referential integerity).
3. Only use records from **RX_CLAIMS** where mail_ind <> 'Y'. We don't want mail-in pharmacy records to create visits as there is no interaction with a health care provider.


## **PROVIDER_ID Assignment Logic**
- For records from **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** and **INPATIENT_CONFINEMENT**:
    - Each record in **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** and **INPATIENT_CONFINEMENT** has a provider value in the PROV field. Use this value to link to **PROVIDER_BRIDGE** to find the PROV_UNIQUE id. 
    - Use the PROV_UNIQUE value to find PROVIDER_ID by linking PROV_UNIQUE to **PROVIDER**.PROVIDER_SOURCE_VALUE. If PROV_UNIQUE does not have an associated PROVIDER_ID then set PROVIDER_ID to 0
- For records from **RX_CLAIMS**:
    - Records in **RX_CLAIMS** have provider values in the fields PRESCRIBING_PROV, NPI, and DEA. 
    - Start with PRESCRIBING_PROV. If that is blank or *NULL* take the NPI and if that is blank or *NULL* take the DEA
    - Using the **PROVIDER_BRIDGE** table find PROV_UNIQUE by matching the PRESCRIBING_PROV value to the PROV field, NPI to NPI or DEA to DEA. 
    - Use the PROV_UNIQUE value to find PROVIDER_ID by linking PROV_UNIQUE to **PROVIDER**.PROVIDER_SOURCE_VALUE. If PROV_UNIQUE does not have an associated PROVIDER_ID then set PROVIDER_ID to 0

## **CARE_SITE_ID Assignment Logic**
-   For records from **MEDICAL_CLAIMS**:
    - Each record in **MEDICAL_CLAIMS**  has a value in the field BILL_PROV. Use this value to link to **PROVIDER_BRIDGE** on BILL_PROV = PROV to find the PROV_UNIQUE id.
    - Use the PROV_UNIQUE value to find CARE_SITE_ID by linking PROV_UNIQUE to **CARE_SITE**.CARE_SITE_SOURCE_VALUE. If PROV_UNIQUE does not have an associated CARE_SITE_ID then set CARE_SITE_ID to 0
- For records from **RX_CLAIMS**: 
    - Each record in **RX_CLAIMS** has a value in the field Pharm. 
    - Link to CARE_SITE by linking Pharm to **CARE_SITE**.CARE_SITE_SOURCE_VALUE. If pharm does not have an associated CARE_SITE_ID then set PROVIDER_ID to 0

## Change Log

### August 9, 2021
* Added 02, 08, 17, 53, 57, 71, 72 to the list of place of service codes where the visit_detail_end_date should be equal to the visit_detail_start_date
* Added 24, 19, 25, 50, 62 to the list of place of service codes where if lst_dt - fst_dt > 1 then set visit_detail_end_date equal to visit_detail_start_date
* Added logic stating if a record with place of service code 22 or 65 has lst_dt - fst_dt > 1 then set VISIT_DETAIL_CONCEPT_ID to 9201

### July 14, 2021
- Removed the claim ids from the VISIT_DETAIL_SOURCE_VALUE. POS value will be used instead. If the record comes from the RX_CLAIMS table then the VISIT_DETAIL_SOURCE_VALUE will be set to either 'Specialty Pharmacy' or 'Pharmacy' based on Spclt_Ind. 
- Removed mail order pharmacy records from creating visits

### September 21, 2020
- Added place of service codes where the VISIT_DETAIL_END_DATE should equal the VISIT_DETAIL_START_DATE.

### September 16, 2020
* Changes to logic on how to assign VISIT_DETAIL_END_DATE. Previously records from RX_CLAIMS had the VISIT_DETAIL_END_DATE set to fill_dt + days_supply-1. This was changed so that the end date is also set to the fill date. 
* Records where the place of service value from MEDICAL_CLAIMS did not have a mapping still took the LST_DT as the VISIT_DETAIL_END_DATE. Many LST_DT values from the source data are incorrect so in the case that POS is blank or cannot be mapped the VISIT_DETAIL_END_DATE is set to the VISIT_DETAIL_START_DATE
* Records from MEDICAL_CLAIMS with POS = 23 and where lst_dt - fst_dt > 1, the VISIT_DETAIL_START_DATE and VISIT_DETAIL_END_DATE are both set to fst_dt. 
* Records from MEDICAL_CLAIMS with POS is equal to 81, 42, 41, 14, 04, 18, 09, 03, 16, the VISIT_DETAIL_START_DATE and VISIT_DETAIL_END_DATE are both set to fst_dt.

#### **Mapping Medical_Claims to concepts for VISIT_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID**

Each record in the **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** table has a value in the fields PROVCAT and PAID_STATUS. Lookup PROVCAT in the provided lookup table to find the CATGY_ROL_UP_4_DESC. Use the table below to assign VISIT_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID based on the combination of PROVCAT.CATGY_ROL_UP_4_DESC and PAID_STATUS
