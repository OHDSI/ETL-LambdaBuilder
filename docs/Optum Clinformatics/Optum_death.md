# CDM Table: DEATH

- DOD: this table will be sourced from the table **Death** - except for persons not in person table. If person is absent in **Death** table, but the fact of death is confirmed by the SES logic (see below), populate the DEATH table as well.
- SES: this table will be algorithmically derived from observations in claims data. 
- Cause of death is not present in source data.

## **DEATH Table Logic**
- Delete person if not in PERSON table.

### **Deriving date of death in DOD**

- If there are outpatient or pharmacy visits (VISIT_CONCEPT_ID in 9202, 581458) with visit start date after 30 days of death date, delete the visit record. 
- If there are inpatient or ER visits (VISIT_CONCEPT_ID in 9201, 9203) with visit start date after 30 days of death date, delete the death record. 
- If the death date occurs before the patient's date of birth, then delete the death record.
- If person is absent in **Death** table, but the fact of death is confirmed by the SES logic (see below), populate the DEATH table as well.

### **Deriving date of death in SES**
- In SES data only, date of death will be derived from claims as follows.
- The date of death will be associated to the VISIT_END_DATE.
- These fields will be scanned for death information:
  1. **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS (Discharge Status)
  1. **MED_DIAGNOSIS** DIAG (ICD10CM or ICD9CM diagnosis codes)
  1. **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DRG

#### Using **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS

DEATH = TRUE where DSTATUS in (21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,40,41,42),
see the descriptions below for the reference:

| Source Field       | Source Code | Source Code Description               | DEATH_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 20           | EXPIRED                                 | 32812        |

| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 22           | EXPIRED TO BE DEFINED AT STATE LEVEL    | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 23           | EXPIRED TO BE DEFINED AT STATE LEVEL    | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 24           | EXPIRED TO BE DEFINED AT STATE LEVEL    | 32812        |

| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 26           | EXPIRED TO BE DEFINED AT STATE LEVEL    | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 27           | EXPIRED TO BE DEFINED AT STATE LEVEL    | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 27           | EXPIRED TO BE DEFINED AT STATE LEVEL    | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 28           | EXPIRED TO BE DEFINED AT STATE LEVEL    | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 29           | EXPIRED TO BE DEFINED AT STATE LEVEL    | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 40           | EXPIRED AT HOME (HOSPICE)               | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 41           | EXPIRED IN A MEDICAL FACILITY (HOSPICE) | 32812        |
| **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS | 42           | EXPIRED â€“ PLACE UNKNOWN (HOSPICE)       | 32812        |


#### Using ICD9CM and ICD10CM from **MED_DIAGNOSIS** DIAG   

Use [Source to Source](code_snippets.md#source-to-source) and filter with
```WHERE SOURCE_VOCABULARY_ID IN ('JNJ_DEATH')``` to find DEATH records using the diagnosis codes. 

#### Using **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DRG 

For DRGs, use the following query.  DRGs are date-sensitve so we need to only pick up DRGs that fall within the valid start and end dates.

```
SELECT CONCEPT_ID, CONCEPT_NAME, CONCEPT_CODE, valid_start_date, valid_end_date
FROM concept
WHERE CONCEPT_ID IN (
  38000421,38001111,38001112,38001113
)
```

*Common Data Model ETL Mapping Specification for Optum Extended SES & Extended DOD*
<br>*CDM Version = 5.4

## Change log

### 04-Dec-2024
- fixed misprint in the delete death record rule (DOD), inpatient VISIT_CONCEPT_ID 9202 -> 9201

### 11-Aug-2023

- table is revived since in CDM v5.4 the death table is present (the file was retired in intent of migration to CDM v6)
- Type concepts are up-to-date
- in DOD usage of SES logic if entry is absent in DEATH table
