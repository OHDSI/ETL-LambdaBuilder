# CDM Table: DEATH

- DOD: this table will be sourced from the table **Death** - except for persons not in person table. If person is absent in **Death** table, but the fact of death is confirmed by information in MEDICAL_CLAIMS.DSTATUS, populate the DEATH table as well.
- SES: As of 2025, we are no longer deriving death data from Optum SES.
- Cause of death is not present in source data.

## **DEATH Table Logic**
- Delete person if not in PERSON table.

### **Deriving date of death from the death record in DOD**

- If the observation_period_start_date occurs prior to the death date, delete the death record
- If the death date occurs before the patient's date of birth, then delete the death record.
- If there are outpatient or pharmacy visits (VISIT_CONCEPT_ID in 9202, 581458) with visit start date after 30 days of death date, delete the visit record. 
- If there are inpatient or ER visits (VISIT_CONCEPT_ID in 9201, 9203) with visit start date after 30 days of death date, delete the death record. 
- If person is absent in **Death** table, but the fact of death is confirmed by the MEDICAL_CLAIMS logic (see below), populate the DEATH table as well.

### **Deriving date of death from MEDICAL_CLAIMS in DOD**
- Date of death will be derived from claims as follows:
- The date of death will be associated to the VISIT_END_DATE.
- These fields will be scanned for death information:
  1. **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS (Discharge Status)

#### Using **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** DSTATUS

DEATH = TRUE where DSTATUS in (21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,40,41,42),
